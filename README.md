# Production Changeover Optimization Problem 
Project Description: 
 This project tackles the production changeover optimization problem. In particular, this project models, formulates, and implements an integer program to solve this problem. In addition, this project includes sample data generation using general estimates to show and indicate the scalability of this optimization projet. 
Running the files: 
This project utilized IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio to run the .mod and .dat files. To run this model on your own data, edit the 'Production_Changeover.dat' file and run the 'Production_Changeover.mod' and 'Production_Changeover.dat' files in conjunction. To generate sample data, run the 'sample_data_generation.ipynb' file and copy paste the final output data into the 'Production_Changeover.dat'.
